// In a shared game a player's screen writes nothing to the game (the host's
// engine owns it), so the institution functions here (institutionLifecycle.js,
// institutionalGovernance.js, institutionalChannels.js) ask the host instead
// when the page plays one: the host runs the same function for this player's
// country (multiplayer/host/institutions.js), and the change comes back in the
// next view of the game. Founding an institution in a shared game used to end
// in a refused write ("409").
//
// The screens use what these functions return to go on: the institution or
// proposal to show, the thread to open. The host answers with their ids, and a
// thread it made is looked for in the documents the page holds until the view
// with it has come.
